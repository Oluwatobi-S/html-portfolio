<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Black Panther</h3>
<p>
One of the most amazing storylines for an Action Superhero Movie. Not your average Superhero/Supervilan movie. I absolutely love Superhero movies. <br/> Made me proud to be of African decent; more specifically Nigerian decent.

<h3>Blue Story</h3>
<p>
A movie that hits very close to HOME. A story that has shaped the rest of my life choices. I've watched it 3 times in a row LOL!
</p>

<h3>Gran Turismo</h3>
<p>
After seeing this movie, I felt unstoppable. Makes me want to continue to chase my dreams and not stop till it becomes my reality.
