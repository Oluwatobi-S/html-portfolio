<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate and self-taught full-stack web developer, with a strong focus on backend development.
  My journey in web development began as a way to channel my love for problem-solving and technology into
  tangible, creative solutions. I recently graduated from the University of Salford in Manchester, where
  I honed my analytical skills in the science field, which now complement my technical expertise in web development.

Since completing my studies, I've been dedicated to building my portfolio and expanding my skills through various 
projects. One of my proudest achievements is launching a website for a marketing agency, AdeMarketing Ltd, where 
I was able to blend sleek design with robust functionality. This project marked a significant milestone in my 
career, showcasing my ability to deliver professional-grade web solutions that meet client needs.

  am always eager to take on new projects that push the boundaries of my capabilities. Whether it's a complex
  backend system or a responsive front-end design, I bring a high level of dedication and enthusiasm to every
  task I undertake.
